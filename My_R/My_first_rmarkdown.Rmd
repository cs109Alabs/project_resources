## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

##Arguments
echo

The argument echo specifies whether the R commands are included (default is TRUE). Adding echo=FALSE in the opening line of the R code block will not include the commmand: ```{r, echo=FALSE}



``` {r first_block, echo=FALSE}
v = c(1,2,3)
v
```

``` {r second_block, echo=TRUE}
v = c(1,2,3)
v
```

eval
The argument eval specifies whether the R commands is evaluated (default is TRUE). Adding eval=FALSE in the opening line of the R code block will not evaluate the commmand: ```{r, eval=FALSE}. Now only the command is shown, but no output.

``` {r 3_block, eval=FALSE}
v = c(1,2,3)
v
```

include

The argument include specifies whether the output is included (default is TRUE). Adding include=FALSE in the opening line of the R code block will not include the commmand: ```{r, include=FALSE}. Now the command and the output are both not shown, but the statement is evaluated.


``` {r 4_block, include=FALSE}
v = c(1,2,3)
v
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r my_plot1, fig.width=12 , fig.height=4, echo=TRUE}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(cars)
# simple comment
plot(pressure)
plot(volcano, col=terrain.colors(50))
```


##Running models on the server or analyses that take time
If you're running analyses that take a long time, or you're running the models on a server:

Include the script for the analysis in your R Markdown file, but make sure the model does not evaluate. Save the model, and load it for further use. For example, include something like this:

```{r pressure2, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
library(CUB)
# Setting an if-statement to false, will prevent the evaluation of this part.
if(FALSE){
  # run this code on the server:
  model <- gam(Y ~ s(Time), data=dat)
  save(model, file="Models/model.rda", compress="xz")
}
# Now download the model, and store it in the directory Models
# Load the model:
load("Models/model.rda")
# ... and continue with your script.

```


Formatting the report
The website http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html provides more information on how to include lists, pictures, etc. Here only a few things are discussed.
